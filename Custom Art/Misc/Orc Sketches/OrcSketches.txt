16-bit SNES 'Chibi' Style Orcs

Included in this folder are scanned paper and pencil sketches of Orcs, drawn in the 'Chibi' art style, characteristics of 16-bit SNES RPGs.  There is a progression in these sketches, starting at Sketch 1 when I was trying to figure out how to draw the 'chibi orc' porportions, to the later sketches.
