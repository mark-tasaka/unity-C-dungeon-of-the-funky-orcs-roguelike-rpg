# 'Dungeon of the Funky Orcs', a rogue-like RPG developed with Unity and C#

‘Dungeon of the Funky Orcs’ is ‘rogue-like’ roleplaying game that I am working on using the Unity Engine and C# coding.  The game involves the exploration of a randomly generated dungeon, filled with monsters and treasures.  The mechanics of the game are simple: explore the dungeon, survive, battle monsters and gain treasure.  The short term goal in designing this game is to develop and document the skills I have learnt in game design using C# coding and the Unity Engine.  The long term goals is to publish ‘Dungeon of the Funky Orcs’; making this game available to the public.
